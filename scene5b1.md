<h1>You throw it away :wastebasket:</h1>
 
 <p>You head out the door & it starts raining so you call your friend to come get you. He pulls up & you get in the car. He says "There you are! Dude you touched this thing, screamed, & sprinted out of the store all the way down the road! I had to buy it after that!" You turn to look in the back seat & there's the crystal ball strapped into the seat."</p>
